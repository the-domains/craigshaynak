Hello, world! It's me, Craig! Yes! You've arrived at my Grid website. I am not sure what to expect from this site, but it sure seems like a crazy experiment.

I am a writer and an actor who also has a lot of experience with database programming and a great love for music and history. I also like steak dinners, late night Chinese food, Indian food, Greek food, and chocolate ice cream. I never used to drink coffee, but one of my writing partners has forced me into drinking it daily. Argh!

I am originally from East Northport, New York on Long Island where I attended Dickinson Avenue School, Northport Junior High School, and finally, Northport Senior High School. I studied French, Russian, Math (Calculus), Physics, Chemistry, Law, and the Great Books. I had the opportunity to practice my Russian in 1987 when I spent the summer in Soviet Union. The Great Books program appealed to my love of discussion as a way of learning and therefore it was no surprise that I ended up at The University of Chicago, birthplace of the Great Books program. I received a very useful degree in Medieval Studies. My faculty advisor was none other than David Bevington, the renowned Shakespeare. While there, I participated in University Theatre and our campus comedy troupe, Off-Off Campus founded by Bernie Sahlins, Frank Kinahan, and Steve Schroer. Bernie Sahlins also famously founded Second City and SCTV. I got my first professional acting gig weeks after I graduated. Having focused on Medieval Drama for my bachelor's degree, I was asked to be the dramaturg for "The Mystery Cycle" at the Court Theatre. When I met the co-director, Bernie Sahlins, he recognized me from the comedy troupe and recommended that I audition. I and a few other students were asked to be in the play and that was the beginning of my professional acting career! Bernie was a mentor to me and used to say to people "I taught this kid everything he knows!"
